HOSPITAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Huge amounts of data are created daily in every healthcare sector. Healthcare analytics is therefore key.  The purpose of healthcare data analytics includes the following: using data-driven findings to predict and solve a problem before it is too late, but also assessing methods and treatments faster, keeping better track of inventory, involving patients more in their own health, and empowering them with the tools to do so.


# BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
The objectives for the analysis include;
Average outpatient(inclusive of copayments) and inpatient medicare payments ranked per provider for each year of available data.
Time series analysis of the average charge on different APC services per provider over the three years
Geographical analysis by the state on affordable providers that offer emergency charges
Analyze the top 10 prominent inpatients' ICD10 diagnoses based on state using their ICD10 Chapter and Block Descriptions

# DATA ANALYSIS
Data Analysis was done using Tableau 
Before the analysis was done the datasets were loaded and previewed on Colab notebook using Python libraries.

I started by loading and previewing the tables in the Outpatient database. Noted that there are 3 tables namely;
Outpatient_charges_2011
Outpatient_charges_2012
Outpatient_charges_2013

I then merged the 3 tables to create one table that has all the outpatient information for the 3 years.

The next step was to merge the inpatient tables to create one table that has all the inpatient information for the 3 years.

After merging the tables, I checked for null values and duplicates and noted that all the datasets do not have duplicates, null values, and hence, do not require any cleaning.

Finally, exported the files to CSV so that I can upload the files to Tableau for Analysis

Analysis
The Analysis was done using Tableau

Time series analysis of the average charge on different APC services per provider over the three years


From the Analysis, we can see that there has been an upward and downward trend in the average total payments over the 3 years.

Geographical analysis by the state on affordable providers that offer emergency charges


From the geographical analysis, we can see that there are over 20 states that offer emergency charges.


Analyze the top 10 prominent inpatients' ICD10 diagnoses based on state using their ICD10 Chapter and Block Descriptions



From the table we can see that ICD Category A92  to D11 are the top 10 prominent diagnosis.


Average outpatient(inclusive of copayments) and inpatient medicare payments ranked per provider for each year of available data




From the 2 tables, we can see that there is no regular trend over the 3 years. 
The average payments increase and decrease over time during the 3 years.
